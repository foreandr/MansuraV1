public chat rooms by algorithm vs private char rooms
10. RETWEET LOGIC

SEARCH
=======
FULL SAME DISTRIBUTION FOR THE SEARCH ALGOS, YOU ARE REWARDED FOR YOUR VOTE THERE TOO

1. NATIVE BOLD/ ITALICS/ UNDERLINE/STRIKETHROUGH FONTS
1. ABLE TO UPLOAD ONCE A [TIME INTERVAL] IF NOT SUBSCRIBED
2. IN THE CSV PRODUCED IN THE HISTORY, ADD SITE COSTS

would also like a way to clean and label data and integrate that with payment
differentiating people who contribute suggestions with code I can implement
fix string interpolation?
    -    data validation function with an assert to check for SQL keywords
RPELY AND COPY LOGICbe able to say explicitly that you fork a dataset, and then be able to show publicly how different the new data is from the old data

SOLUTION FOR COST OF CLOUD STORAGE GETTING TOO height
	- I CAN MOVE THE FILES MANUALLY BY THEIR CREATION DATE OR ID OR SOMETHING
	- DRAG THEM INTO PHYSICAL STORAGE
	- WHEN SOMEBODY WANTS ONE OF THOSE OLD FILES, SERVER MAKES A CALL TO PHYSICAL STORAGE FILE SERVER RUNNING ON A LOCAL MACHINE
	- AND SENDS THEM THE FILE
