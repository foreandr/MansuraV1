========================
CHANGE VOTING TO 30 4 1
TODAY AT LIBRARY:
	1.First n people to join this month get in free, (xd)
		- person who is reffered gets yearly vote (that they keep if they sub, they have sub to claim!)-and the referer only claims his rewards on subsciption of referred acount
		- the correct judgment is if reffered you get EXTRA
		- person who refers gets 1 monthly vote for EACH refer
		-   
	2. WRITE UP THE PAPER
	4. CODE FOR CHECKING HOW SIMILAR TWO PIECES OF TEXT ARE
	5. JIRA CONFLUENCE DOCUMENTATION 
	6. SEARCH BASIC
	

1. TEXT CHECK AND IMAGE CHECK WORKING PROPERLY, mild frontend checks as well
2. LIKES TABLE (WITH SIMILAR LOGIC TO VOTES)[MAY NOT NEED DATE SOME OTHER MINOR STUFF]
	- LIKES WILL INFORM SEARCH
	
3. BASIC SEARCH BY KEYWORD, (BY TEXT AND USERNAME) (FIRST N[200?] RESULTS)
	- SOMETHING wrong with the ordering of files
	- should test their search ona test net, tell them it will be verified over a business day
		- if test net no shenanigans, create place somewhere to store query
		- perm ban if shenanigans from submitting search algo
		- add tags to text inserts to help the search algo
5. withdrawl isn't finishe
6. GET UPLOADS ACTUALLY WORKING, 
	-. LIMIT NUM POSTS PER DAY
	- CHECK having modal issue
	- CHECKSOME UPLOADS HAVE RANDOM SLASHES IN THEM FOR UPLOAD NUMS
7. allow for profile bio
	- EDIT BIO
	- a full page on it's own for editing profile including picture and bio, and presumabley other things of that nature
8. maybe in settings?show publicly content moderation policy with, {here are the bad words, don't threaten national security}
9. REPOST, ability to take another post and endorse it somehow 
10. show publicly how many people have blocked this person
11. DO THIS BY REPORT(NO WAY IM GOING TO MANAGE THIS WITH SEARCH)
	- if a post is character for character the same, look for the one with the earliest timestamp, they get all the winnings
	- SUCCESSFULL REPORTER GETS 50% 
12. HEAD TO HEADS (incomplete but something like this should be thought through carefully)
	- YOU can report someones post, and then that inverts the vote ratio so you have a head to head between reports and votes for that month
	- the people who report if successful will get the winnings of what that page would have got
		- else they just lost their vote for the month
13. POST TO LIKE RATIO NEXT TO LIST ON PROFILE OF WHO BLOCKS? RATING OF ACCOUNTS?
15. COPY OF SOMETHING ELSE REPORT LOGIC
	- RETWEET LOGIC
16. IF A POST GETS REPORTED, AND THE REPORT IS SUCCESSFUL (NEED LOGIC FOR DETERMINING THAT), THAT POST GETS PINNED ON THEIR PROFILE, AND THEY GET SLASHED SOME TO THE POOL SOME TO THE REPORTERS
	- every post is scored with some point system, if the points to remove > 100 or something, and 2x score of regular vots, it gets shadowbanned in some way
17. redirected to wrong page after follow
18. LEFT HAND SIDE, CURRENT MONTH LEADERBOARDS EQUITY, DOWNWARD TO POSTS
19. PUT THE MNT FOLDER INISDE OF THE STATIC FOLDER!!
20. BUY ADS TO PUT ON THE MAIN PAGE, ALL GOES TO POOL, BUY ADS TO PUT ON A PERSONS PAGE, 50% GOES TO THEM, 50% GOES TO POOL



IMPORTANT BUT LATER
===================
#liek clauses case insensitive
#UNIT TEST THHIS, WHEN COMMITING, DEMONSTRATE IT'S OFF
#ALSO SOME WEIRD SESSION ISSUES, if it thinks youre logged in, you cant go to the log in screen, maybe redirect to profile or something instead, and if there is no profile, , redirect o login
#CHANGE TESTNET PAYPAL OFF LIVE
