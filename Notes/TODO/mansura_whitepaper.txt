MANSURA

WHITEPAPER
    Towards a Financial Cybernetic Collective
    
INTRODUCTION
    The proliferation of social media has had a tremendous impact on our society. There have been numerous efforts
    over the last few decades to get the formula right, with varying degress of success. This is our attempt.

COMMON PROBLEMS
    Before I begin describing the bells and whistles of Mansura, I would first like to lay out our view of what seem to be 
    some of the common issues that people are facing.
    
    1. FINANCIAL/ INCENTIVE : the distribution of the capital for participation in the network. Either as creator OR consumer.
        - Incentive for posting equal distribution dependant on what percent of the votes they got]
        - incentive for liking they are rewarded depending on the distribution algorithms
        - Reply/Citation/Ratio incentive
    6. CURATION & SEARCH ALGORITHMS
        - custom search queries arbitrary precision and complexity
        - compose the queries of others to make new ones
        - query creators get paid based on the use of their things
            - peoeple can use each others search, nothing pre curated
    2. IDENTITY / OWNERSHIP   : when I interact with the network, I either do, or DON'T want people to know who I am, 
        - and I don't want to be impersonated. I also want to be rewarded for what I make, and if someone copies me, I should get credit
    3. BOTS/SPAM
        - BOTS won't ever be stopped but they can be disincentivized, you can make bot accounts, but they just ocntribute
    5. TRANSPARENCY
        - public distribution log for every time there is a reset
